# UFO Sightings

## Overview
In this project, I constructed a webpage that displays a table of information about different UFO sightings from January of 2010 and allows users to filter that table based on five different elements.
## Results
In order to perform a search, you must input your search criteris into one of the filter input forms shown below, and then press the enter/return key:

![FILTER IMAGE ](https://github.com/AbeSchnake/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Filters.png)

Be sure to use all lowercase letters when filtering, all of the data is in lowercase and the filter is case-sensitive. When the data is filtered by inputting "CA" into the State box, the result is a blank table, as shown below:

![UPPERCASE IMAGE](https://github.com/AbeSchnake/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/uppercase.png)

However, when you input "ca" in lowercase, you can see a table displaying all of the sightings that took place in California, as shown below:

## Summary
A major drawback of this web page is that the search criteria are case-sensitive. I'm sure there's a way to make sure the criteria are not case-sensitive, and adding that feature would enhance the user experience. A second feature that would improve the website would be if the table of UFO information included a link to the source of the information. Allowing users to access the news reports or firsthand witness accouts would aid the more curious UFOlogists in doing their own further research.
